		History:
			</font size></p>
		<br>				
<p>
	Introduced in <strong>1966</strong> as a companion to Fender's shorter-scaled, two-pickup <u>Fender Mustang guitars</u>, the <u>Mustang Bass</u> was the last original bass designed by <i> Leo Fender </i> before his departure from the company in <strong>1965</strong>. 
	The standard finishes were <i>red</i> and <i>white</i>. <u>Mustang Basses</u>, like all <u>Fender guitars</u>, were finished in <i>nitrocellulose lacquer</i> up until <strong>1968</strong>, thereafter in <i>thick polyester finish</i>. In <strong>1969</strong>, both the <u>Mustang guitar</u> and <u>bass</u> were issued with 'Competition' finishes, <i>red</i> with <i>three white stripes</i>, a <i>thick one</i> between <i>two thinner ones</i>, <i>Lake Placid Blue</i> with <i>lighter blue stripes</i>, etc. and were later available in <i>various plain finishes</i> including <i>black</i> and <i>sunburst</i>. The <i>yellowing</i> of the lacquer on some early models has also resulted in <i>"rare"</i> colours like <i>Surf Green</i>, in reality a <i>yellowed Competition Blue</i>.In production almost continuously to <strong>1981</strong>, the <u>Mustang Bass</u> was reissued by <i>Fender Japan</i> in <strong>2002</strong>.

	The <u>Musicmaster Bass</u> variant was also introduced in the <strong>mid-1960s</strong> and was <i>originally</i> marketed as a <i>student model</i>. Rather than the split-coil design of the <u>Mustang Bass</u>, it featured a single-coil pickup, which was actually a six-pole <u>Stratocaster</u> guitar pickup under a solid plastic cover. Production ceased around the same time as the <u>Mustang Bass</u>. The <u>Squier Musicmaster Bass</u> was reissued briefly in <strong>1997</strong>, however it was discontinued after only one year of production and was ultimately replaced by the <u>Bronco Bass</u>. <u>Fender</u> reintroduced the <u>Mustang Bass</u> as part of the <u>Squier</u> lineup. The <u>Squier Vintage Modified Mustang Bass</u> was released in <strong>July 2011</strong>, offered in <i>black</i>, or <i>three-tone sunburst</i> with a <i>maple fretboard</i>, a <i>black pickguard</i> and <u>Stratocaster</u> style volume and tone knobs. This model has since been discontinued.

<p>
	For <strong>2013</strong>, <u>Fender</u> launched three new <u>Mustang basses</u> in the <i>Pawn Shop series</i>, 
	which they call an unconventional assortment of <i>"guitars that never were but should have been"</i>. They evoke the original "competition" <u>Mustangs</u> of the <strong>early 1970s</strong>. These <u>basses</u> are available in <i>Candy Apple Red</i> with <i>white stripes</i>, <i>Olympic White</i> with <i>blue stripes</i>, and <i>three color sunburst</i>. Their features include an alder body, "C"-shaped maple neck, 9.5-inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 19 medium jumbo frets, <i>four-ply white pearloid pick-guard</i>, two Jazz Bass control knobs (volume and tone) and a strings-through-body bridge with four adjustable saddles. This time, though, one obtains the huge bass sound of a single humbucking pickup whereas the original had a single-coil pickup. <u>The Pawn Shop Mustang basses</u> were made by <i>Fender Mexico</i>. A new <u>Fender Mustang PJ model</u> was released at Summer NAMM, <strong>2016</strong>. This model features both P-Bass and Jazz Bass style pickups and is available in <i>Olympic White</i>, <i>Sonic Blue</i> and <i>Torino Red</i>. <i>Capri Orange</i> was introduced in <strong>2017</strong>. The <i>Mustang PJ</i> is offered with a pao ferro fretboard as of <strong>2018</strong>.<br>
